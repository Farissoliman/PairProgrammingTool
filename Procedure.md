# Procedure

_A check mark âœ… means the step is implemented/can be performed using the current version of the codebase._

## Setup

1. âœ… Pair up computers, where one is Partner A and the other is Partner B
2. âœ… Copy each ID from the web app to the Python program
3. âœ… Copy Partner A's unique ID and paste it into the text field on Partner B's computer

## During the study

Partner A will start out as the driver.

4. âœ… Partner A clicks the "Start Session" button, which starts the session for both participants.
5. âœ… At any point during the study, participants can switch between driver and navigator.
   - âœ… When this happens, the frontend sends a WebSocket message to the backend.
   - âœ… Then, the backend will send a WebSocket message to Partner A and B requesting data from the last interval.
   - ðŸ—™ The Python programs running on the background on both machines will reply.
   - âœ…After replies are received from both Partner A and B, the backend commits this information in MongoDB.
   - âœ… Then, the backend sends a follow-up message to both computers indicating the start of a new interval with reversed roles.

### Starting the session

    participant Ac as Background Program (A)
    actor A as Partner A
    participant Server
    actor B as Partner B
    participant Bc as Background Program (B)
    A->>Server: Start Session
    Server->>Ac: Start
    note over A: (Starts as the driver)
    Server->>Bc: Start
    note over B: (Starts as the navigator)
    note over Ac: Starts recording data
    note over Bc: Starts recording data
```

### Switching roles

    participant Ac as Background Program (A)
    actor A as Partner A
    participant Server
    actor B as Partner B
    participant Bc as Background Program (B)
    A->>Server: Request switch
    note over A: (Navigator)
    note over B: (Driver)
    Server->>Ac: Request data
    Ac->>Server: Response with interval data
    Server->>Bc: Request data
    Bc->>Server: Response with interval data
    note over Server: Data is stored in MongoDB
    Server->>A: Finalize role switch
    note over A: (Driver)
    Server->>B: Finalize role switch
    note over B: (Navigator)
    note over Ac: Data collection restarts
    note over Bc: Data collection restarts
```

## Web-based Interface

The web interface will be embedded as a WebView in a VS Code extension. It will rely on polling to fetch data from the backend and show it to the user when the extension's panel is open.
